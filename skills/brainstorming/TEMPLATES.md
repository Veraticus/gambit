# Epic and Task Templates

Full templates for creating epics and first tasks. SKILL.md has condensed versions — use these for complete output.

## Epic Template

```
TaskCreate
  subject: "Epic: [Feature Name]"
  description: |
    ## Requirements (IMMUTABLE)
    [What MUST be true when complete — specific, testable]
    - Requirement 1: [concrete requirement]
    - Requirement 2: [concrete requirement]
    - Requirement 3: [concrete requirement]

    ## Success Criteria (MUST ALL BE TRUE)
    - [ ] Criterion 1 (objective, testable — e.g., 'Integration tests pass')
    - [ ] Criterion 2 (objective, testable — e.g., 'Works with existing User model')
    - [ ] All tests passing
    - [ ] Pre-commit hooks passing

    ## Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN)
    - NO [Pattern 1] (reason: [why forbidden])
    - NO [Pattern 2] (reason: [why forbidden])
    - NO [Pattern 3] (reason: [why forbidden])

    ## Approach
    [2-3 paragraph summary of chosen approach]

    ## Architecture
    [Key components, data flow, integration points]

    ## Approaches Considered

    ### 1. [Chosen Approach] — CHOSEN
    **What:** [2-3 sentence description]
    **Investigation:** [What was researched]
    **Pros:** [benefits]
    **Cons:** [drawbacks]
    **Chosen because:** [specific reasoning]

    ### 2. [Rejected Approach] — REJECTED
    **What:** [2-3 sentence description]
    **Why explored:** [What made it seem viable]
    **Investigation:** [What was researched]
    **Pros:** [benefits]
    **Cons:** [fatal flaw]
    **REJECTED BECAUSE:** [specific reason]
    **DO NOT REVISIT UNLESS:** [condition that would change decision]

    ## Scope Boundaries
    **In scope:**
    - [explicit inclusions]

    **Out of scope:**
    - [explicit exclusions with reasoning]

    ## Open Questions
    - [uncertainties to resolve during implementation]
    - [decisions deferred to execution phase]
  activeForm: "Planning [feature name]"
```

### Anti-Pattern Examples

```
- NO localStorage tokens (reason: httpOnly prevents XSS token theft)
- NO new user model (reason: must integrate with existing db/models/user.ts)
- NO mocking OAuth in integration tests (reason: defeats purpose of testing real flow)
- NO Socket.IO (reason: user confirmed mobile clients use raw WebSocket)
- NO separate WebSocket port (reason: deployment complexity, firewall rules)
```

## First Task Template

```
TaskCreate
  subject: "Add [specific deliverable]"
  description: |
    ## Goal
    [What this task delivers — one clear outcome]

    ## Implementation

    1. Study existing code
       [Point to 2-3 similar implementations: file.ts:line]

    2. Write tests first (TDD)
       [Specific test cases for this task]

    3. Implementation checklist
       - [ ] file.ts:line - function_name() - [what it does]
       - [ ] test.ts:line - test_name() - [what it tests]

    ## Success Criteria
    - [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome]
    - [ ] Tests passing
    - [ ] Pre-commit hooks passing
  activeForm: "Adding [deliverable]"
```
