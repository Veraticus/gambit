# Test-Driven Development

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass. Refactor. Commit.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using gambit:test-driven-development to implement this with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR."

## Rigidity Level

LOW FREEDOM — Follow these exact steps in order. Do not adapt, skip, or reorder.

Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Expected Result |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **RED** | Write one failing test | Test FAILS with expected message |
| **Verify RED** | Run test, read failure | Fails because feature missing (not typo) |
| **GREEN** | Write minimal code | Test passes |
| **Verify GREEN** | Run ALL tests | All green, no regressions |
| **REFACTOR** | Clean up while green | Tests still pass |
| **COMMIT** | Commit the increment | Behavior captured |

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Wrote code before the test? **Delete it. Start over.**

- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete

Fresh implementation from tests. No exceptions.

## When to Use

**Always when writing production code:**
- New features or functions
- Bug fixes (test reproduces the bug first)
- Behavior changes during refactoring
- Any code that should have test coverage

**Exceptions (confirm with your human partner):**
- Throwaway prototypes (will be deleted)
- Generated code (output, not generators)
- Configuration files

### TDD vs Executing-Plans

These skills are complementary, not competing:

| | TDD | Executing-Plans |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Single function or behavior | Multi-task epic |
| **Controls** | HOW code is written | WHICH task, WHEN to stop |
| **Cycle** | RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → COMMIT | Load → Execute → Checkpoint → STOP |
| **Checkpoints** | After each test passes | After each task completes |
| **Relationship** | Called BY executing-plans | Calls TDD during execution |

TDD is a coding discipline used WITHIN task execution. Executing-plans decides WHAT to build; TDD decides HOW to build it.

## The Process

### 1. RED — Write One Failing Test

Write a single test for **one behavior**. Not two. Not "and."

**Requirements:**
- Test ONE behavior ("and" in name? Split it)
- Name describes the behavior: `test_rejects_empty_email`, not `test_email`
- Use real objects, not mocks (unless external dependency)
- Assert on behavior, not implementation details

**Run the test. Read the failure message.**

Confirm ALL THREE:
- Test **fails** (not errors with syntax issues)
- Failure message matches expectation ("function not found" or assertion mismatch)
- Fails because feature is MISSING, not because of typos

**If test passes immediately:** Your test is wrong. It tests existing behavior, not new behavior. Fix the test before continuing.

**If test has syntax errors:** Fix syntax, re-run until you get a proper assertion failure.

### 2. GREEN — Write Minimal Code

Write the **simplest** code that makes the test pass. Nothing more.

**Minimal means:**
- No features the test doesn't exercise
- No error handling the test doesn't check
- No type annotations the test doesn't require
- No docstrings or comments
- Hardcoded values are fine if only one test exercises the case

**Run ALL tests** (not just the new one). Confirm:
- New test passes
- All existing tests still pass
- No warnings or errors

**If new test fails:** Fix code, not test.
**If other tests break:** Fix regressions NOW, before continuing.

### 3. REFACTOR — Clean Up While Green

Only after ALL tests pass:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers if repeated
- Simplify logic

**Run tests after each refactoring change.** If tests break, undo the refactoring step.

Do NOT add behavior during refactoring. No new features, no new edge cases. Those are new RED cycles.

### 4. COMMIT — Capture the Increment

```bash
git add [test file] [implementation file]
git commit -m "feat(module): [behavior description]"
```

Commit message describes the **behavior**, not the test.

### 5. REPEAT

Next behavior → next failing test → next minimal implementation.

Each RED-GREEN-REFACTOR-COMMIT cycle should be small — one behavior at a time.

## Bug Fix Workflow

Bug fixes follow TDD too. The test reproduces the bug.

1. **RED:** Write test that exercises the buggy input/behavior
2. **Verify RED:** Run test — confirms the bug exists (test fails)
3. **GREEN:** Fix the bug with minimal change
4. **Verify GREEN:** Run ALL tests — bug fixed, no regressions
5. **COMMIT:** The regression test permanently guards against this bug

## Example: Feature with TDD

**Task:** Add email validation that rejects empty strings and missing @ symbols.

**RED:**
```python
def test_rejects_empty_email():
    result = validate_email("")
    assert result is False
```

**Verify RED:**
```
$ pytest -k test_rejects_empty_email
FAILED: NameError: name 'validate_email' is not defined
```
Good — fails because function doesn't exist.

**GREEN:**
```python
def validate_email(email):
    if not email:
        return False
    return True
```
Minimal. Only handles the case the test checks.

**Verify GREEN:**
```
$ pytest
4 passed
```

**Next RED** (new behavior):
```python
def test_rejects_missing_at_symbol():
    result = validate_email("userexample.com")
    assert result is False
```

**Verify RED → GREEN → Verify GREEN → REFACTOR → COMMIT → REPEAT.**

## Testing Anti-Patterns

### Never Test Mock Behavior

```
BAD:  assert mock.was_called()        # Tests plumbing, not behavior
GOOD: assert result == expected_value  # Tests actual output
```

### Never Add Test-Only Code to Production

```
BAD:  def reset(self): ...  # Only used in tests, dangerous in prod
GOOD: Test utilities handle setup/teardown externally
```

### Never Mock Without Understanding

Before mocking any dependency:
1. What side effects does the real code have?
2. Does this test depend on those side effects?
3. If yes → mock at a lower level, not this method

## Red Flags — STOP and Start Over

- Wrote code before test
- Test passes immediately
- Can't explain why test failed
- Adding features during GREEN beyond what test requires
- Tests added "later"
- Rationalizing "just this once"
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Keep as reference" or "adapt existing code"
- "Already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with RED.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. Can't re-run. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost. Unverified code is debt. |
| "Need to explore first" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with RED. |
| "Test is hard to write" | Hard to test = hard to use. Simplify the design. |
| "TDD slows me down" | TDD is faster than debugging in production. |
| "This is different because..." | It's not. RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. |

## Language-Specific Commands

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for test runner commands by language (Go, TypeScript, Rust, Python, Ruby, etc.).

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test **fail** before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test (no extras)
- [ ] All tests pass with no warnings
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases covered as separate RED-GREEN cycles
- [ ] Changes committed after each green cycle

**Can't check all boxes?** You skipped TDD. Start over.

## Integration

**Called by:**
- `gambit:executing-plans` (when implementing task steps)
- `gambit:debugging` (write failing test reproducing bug)

**Calls:**
- `gambit:verification` (running tests to verify RED and GREEN)

**Workflow:**
```
RED (write test) → Verify fail → GREEN (minimal code) → Verify pass → REFACTOR → COMMIT → REPEAT
```
