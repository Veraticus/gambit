# Finishing a Branch

## Overview

Complete development work by verifying readiness, presenting integration options, and executing the user's choice. Handles merge, PR creation, keeping work, or discarding — with appropriate safety gates for each.

**Core principle:** Verify everything passes → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up only what should be cleaned up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using gambit:finishing-branch to complete this work."

## Rigidity Level

LOW FREEDOM — Follow the process exactly. Never skip test verification. Never discard without typed confirmation. Always use AskUserQuestion for options.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Action | STOP If |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. Verify Tasks** | `TaskList` — all must be "completed" | Any task incomplete |
| **2. Verify Tests** | Run full test suite | Any test fails |
| **3. Base Branch** | Detect via git merge-base | Can't determine base |
| **4. Present Options** | `AskUserQuestion` with 4 choices | No response |
| **5. Execute Choice** | Merge / PR / Keep / Discard | Git command fails |
| **6. Cleanup** | Remove worktree if applicable | Only for merge/discard |

**Iron Law:** Tests must pass BEFORE presenting options. No exceptions.

## When to Use

- All tasks for an epic show "completed"
- Implementation reviewed and ready to integrate
- After `gambit:executing-plans` completes all tasks

**Don't use when:**
- Tasks still open → use `gambit:executing-plans`
- Tests failing → fix first
- Work still in progress
- No epic exists → use `gambit:brainstorming`

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify All Tasks Complete

Run `TaskList`. All tasks must show status="completed".

**If tasks still open — STOP:**

```
Cannot finish: N tasks still open:
- [task-id]: Task Name (status: in_progress)
- [task-id]: Task Name (status: pending)

Complete all tasks before finishing.
```

**If all complete:** Read the epic with `TaskGet` and verify all success criteria are met.

---

### Step 2: Verify Tests Pass

**Run the project's full test suite.** Detect the test command from project files (go.mod → `go test ./...`, package.json → `npm test`, Cargo.toml → `cargo test`, pyproject.toml → `pytest`, Makefile → `make test`).

- All tests pass → Step 3
- Any test fails → **STOP.** Show failures. Cannot proceed until tests pass.

---

### Step 3: Determine Base Branch

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

If this fails, ask the user what base branch to use.

---

### Step 4: Present Options

**Use AskUserQuestion — do not print options as text.**

```
AskUserQuestion
  questions:
    - question: "All tasks complete, tests passing. How should we integrate?"
      header: "Integration"
      options:
        - label: "Merge locally"
          description: "Merge to <base-branch>, delete feature branch"
        - label: "Create Pull Request"
          description: "Push and create PR for review"
        - label: "Keep as-is"
          description: "Leave branch and worktree, handle later"
        - label: "Discard"
          description: "Delete all work (requires typed confirmation)"
      multiSelect: false
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response. Do not add recommendations, defaults, or explanations.

**The 4 options above are fixed.** Never modify, reorder, add variants (like "merge and push"), or remove any. The "Never push main" rule means pushing is never offered — user pushes manually after merge.

---

### Step 5: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

1. `git checkout <base-branch>`
2. `git pull`
3. `git merge <feature-branch>`
4. **Run tests on merged result** — if tests fail, present sub-options:
   - Fix failures before completing
   - Abort merge (`git merge --abort`)

   **STOP and wait for user choice.**
5. `git branch -d <feature-branch>` (safe delete)
6. Go to Step 6

**Do NOT push to remote.** User pushes when ready.

---

#### Option 2: Create Pull Request

1. `git push -u origin <feature-branch>`
2. Read epic with `TaskGet` for PR content
3. Create PR:

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: <epic-name>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets from epic requirements>

## Tasks Completed
<list from TaskList>

## Test Plan
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] <verification steps from epic>
EOF
)"
```

4. Report PR URL

**DONE — do NOT go to Step 6.** Branch and worktree (if any) are preserved for PR feedback.

---

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch `<name>`." If worktree exists, add: "Worktree preserved at `<path>`."

**DONE — do NOT go to Step 6.**

---

#### Option 4: Discard

1. Show what will be deleted:

```bash
git log --oneline <base-branch>..HEAD
```

2. **Request typed confirmation:**

```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All N commits listed above
- Worktree at <path> (if applicable)

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

**STOP.** Wait for exact text "discard". Anything else → clarify, do not proceed.

3. `git checkout <base-branch>`
4. `git branch -D <feature-branch>`
5. Go to Step 6

---

### Step 6: Cleanup (Merge and Discard Only)

**Only runs for Options 1 and 4. Options 2 and 3 skip this entirely.**

Check if a worktree exists for this branch:

```bash
git worktree list
```

- Worktree found → `git worktree remove <path>`
- No worktree → skip (branch may not have used one)

Report cleanup results.

---

## Examples

### Good: Full Merge Process

```
Step 1: TaskList → all 4 tasks completed
Step 2: npm test → 127 tests passed
Step 3: git merge-base HEAD main → abc123
Step 4: [AskUserQuestion with 4 options]
         User selects: Merge locally
Step 5: git checkout main
        git pull
        git merge feature-auth
        npm test → 127 tests passed  (verify merged result)
        git branch -d feature-auth
Step 6: git worktree remove .worktrees/auth

Done. Feature merged to main.
```

### Bad: Skip Tests + Cleanup PR Worktree

```
Step 1: Tasks complete
Step 2: SKIPPED             ← WRONG: tests might fail
Step 4: User selects PR
Step 5: git push, gh pr create
        git worktree remove  ← WRONG: PR needs worktree

# Merged broken code. Lost worktree for PR feedback.
```

### Good: Discard With Typed Confirmation

```
git log --oneline main..HEAD
→ a1b2c3d Add OAuth
→ d4e5f6g Add rate limiting

"This will permanently delete branch and 2 commits.
 Type 'discard' to confirm."

User: "discard"

git checkout main && git branch -D feature-experimental
git worktree remove .worktrees/experimental
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Tests before options** — run full suite, show output, never skip
2. **AskUserQuestion for options** — never print options as text
3. **Typed "discard" for Option 4** — exact text, no shortcuts
4. **No worktree cleanup for PR or Keep** — user needs it for feedback/later work
5. **Verify tests after merge** — merged result might have conflicts
6. **All tasks complete first** — no "mostly done" exceptions
7. **Never push main** — not even as an option; user pushes manually
8. **Fixed option set** — the 4 options are immutable; never add "merge and push" or other variants

**Common rationalizations (all mean STOP, follow the process):**

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tests passed earlier" | RUN THEM NOW — code might have changed |
| "User obviously wants to merge" | PRESENT ALL 4 OPTIONS — let them choose |
| "User said discard" | GET TYPED CONFIRMATION — "discard" exactly |
| "PR done, cleanup worktree" | KEEP IT — PR will need updates |
| "Tasks are mostly done" | ALL must be complete — no exceptions |

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All tasks show "completed" (`TaskList`)
- [ ] Tests verified passing (ran them, showed output)
- [ ] Base branch determined
- [ ] Presented 4 options via `AskUserQuestion`
- [ ] Waited for user choice
- [ ] If merge: verified tests on merged result, did NOT push main
- [ ] If PR: reported URL, kept worktree
- [ ] If discard: got typed "discard" confirmation
- [ ] If merge/discard: cleaned up worktree (if one existed)
- [ ] If PR/keep: did NOT cleanup worktree

## Integration

**Called by:**
- User via `/gambit:finishing-branch`
- After `gambit:executing-plans` completes all tasks

**Calls:**
- `gh` CLI (PR creation)
- `git` commands (merge, branch, worktree)

**Pairs with:**
- `gambit:using-worktrees` — cleans up worktree created by that skill
