# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Gambit is a Claude Code plugin providing structured development workflows using native Tasks. It combines the polish of [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) with the rigor of [hyperpowers](https://github.com/withzombies/hyperpowers), replacing external CLI tools (beads/bd) with Claude Code's native Task system.

**Installation:** `/plugin marketplace add Veraticus/gambit && /plugin install gambit@gambit`

## Key Concepts

### Skills
Skills are executable markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Each defines a workflow (TDD, debugging, refactoring, etc.) with:
- **Overview** and core principle
- **When to Use** (triggers)
- **The Process** (numbered steps)
- **Anti-patterns** (what NOT to do)
- **Rigidity level** (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH FREEDOM)

### Native Tasks
Gambit uses Claude Code's Task system exclusively:
- `TaskCreate` — Create tasks with dependencies
- `TaskUpdate` — Mark in_progress/completed, add blockers via `addBlockedBy`
- `TaskList` — Find next ready task
- **Tasks are source of truth** — never track work mentally

### Core Principles
1. **One-task-then-stop** — Human checkpoint after each task
2. **Immutable requirements** — Epic Task requirements don't change; subtasks adapt
3. **Evidence over assertions** — Run verification, show output, then claim done
4. **Small steps that stay green** — Tests pass between every change

## Skill Structure

When creating or modifying skills, use this structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description for discovery
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
What this skill does and core principle.

## When to Use
Triggers and symptoms that indicate this skill applies.

## The Process
Step-by-step, numbered, explicit.

## Examples
Good and bad examples with explanations.

## Anti-patterns
What NOT to do and why.

## Integration
- Called by: which skills invoke this
- Calls: which skills this invokes
```

## Hook System

Hooks are bash scripts that run at lifecycle points. They read JSON from stdin and optionally write JSON to stdout.

**Testing hooks:**
```bash
echo '{"prompt": "Fix this bug"}' | ./hooks/user-prompt-submit/skill-activator.sh
echo '{"response": "Done!"}' | ./hooks/stop/gentle-reminders.sh
```

**Dependencies:** `bash` 4.0+, `jq`

## Development Notes

- This is documentation-first: skills are markdown, hooks are bash
- No build step or package.json — the skill files are the deliverables
- Test skills by invoking them as a subagent before finalizing
- See PLAN.md for the complete specification and phase roadmap
